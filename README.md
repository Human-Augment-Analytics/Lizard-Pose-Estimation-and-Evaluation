## What DLC Does

DLC trains and uses deep learning-based models to conduct pose estimation on videos of one or multiple animals.

## What SLEAP Does

SLEAP is another a good way train and use deep learning-based models that can automatically track the movements of any body parts of any number or type of animal from recorded videos.â€¯ 

## What B-SOiD Does

B-SOiD (Behavioral Segmentation of Open-field In Deep Learning) allows users to find behaviors using unsupervised learning - without the need for annotated data. Specifically, B-SOiD finds clusters in animal behavior using pose estimation data from another tool such as DeepLabCut. Seven low-covalence features are used in combination with the t-SNE and GMM algorithms to cluster the data [1]. Finally, the likelihood processing step helps to define poses and occlusions [1]. In this demonstration, DeepLabCut videos and their corresponding h5 files were used.
